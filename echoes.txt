	Echoes: Pink floyd
Overhead the albatross hangs motionless upon the air
And deep beneath the rolling waves in labyrinths of coral caves
The echoes of a distant tide
Comes willowing across the sand
And everything is green and submarine
And no one showed us to the land and no one knows the where's or why's
But something stirs and something tries
Starts to climb towards the light.

Strangers passing in the street
By chance two separate glances meet
And I am you and what I see is me
And do I take you by the hand
And lead you through the land
And help me understand the best I can
And no one calls us to move on and no one forces down our eyes
No one speaks and no one tries
No one flies around the sun.

Cloudless everyday you fall upon my waking eyes
Inviting and inciting me to rise
And through the window in the wall
come streaming in on sunlight wings
A million bright ambassadors of morning
And no one sings me lullabies and no one makes me close my eyes
So I throw the windows wide and call to you across the sky.
